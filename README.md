# Graph-Isomorphism
The purpose of this repository is to explain the main concepts of graph isomorphism and demostrate isomorphism in pyton code using jumpter notebook. The following are found in this repository.

* python code that implements isomorphism.
* explaination of graph isomorphism problem
* explaination of how graphs can be viewed
* explaination of computation complexity of isomorphism
